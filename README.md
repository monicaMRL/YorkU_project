# YorkU_project
This was the project I did under Prof. Micheal Jenkin as Mitac Globalink Research intern. 

Short Summary: During my summer internship at York University I programmed an aquatic agent to drive autonomously on the pond. Project involved localising this aquatic agent on a water body using particle filter where correction feedback on position of the robot was obtained using off-board camera and on board IMU. Position of the robot was tracked using Homography and coloured object tracking. Image shows the user interface I programmed to control the agent. Click on the link in the heading for the video.
